# Bootstrap-Portfolio

# AjayaBT Portfolio

## Description

This is an early version of my portfolio. Currently, the only deployed app is portfolio which we worked on as the first challenge. The original portfolio was developed without using bootstrap and there is a link included in this README.

All the other images/links are placeholders.

Similar to the first portfolio, it is an ugly page as I was more concerned with the structure at the moment and work will be ongoing regarding the design of the page.

The name of the repo is not as specific as I would like as the instructions given in the challenge were to name the repo "Bootstrap-portfolio"


## Installation

This is a webpage, the link to which can be found below:



additionally, this is the link to the github repository:

https://github.com/ajayabt/Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Usage

This webpage is designed to illustrate the deployed applications of a developer (me). There is only one link to a webpage which I have had input on as mentioned above.

Links are live to generic webpages, e.g. facebook link will go to facebook, not my facebook profile. 



## Credits
Bootstrap has been used for major elements within the code e.g. Jumbotron, cards, accordian, navbar and footer. Any custimisation and layout is my own work. Thank you to the bootcamp instructors and TAs who have enabled me to get this far!
